  Abstract                 = {In the last decade, the growing interest in evaluation of information visualization techniques is a clear indication that usability and user experience are very important quality criteria in this context. However, beyond this level of agreement there is much room for discussion about how to extend the variety of usability evaluation approaches for assessing information visualization techniques, and how to determine which ones are the most effective, and in what ways and for what purposes. In this chapter we take a user centered, Human-Computer Interaction-based perspective to discuss usability evaluation of information visualization techniques. We begin by presenting a singular view of the evolution of visualization techniques evaluation, briefly summarizing the main contributions of several works in this area since its humble beginning as a collateral activity until the recent growth of interest. Then, we focus on current issues related to such evaluations, particularly concerning the way they are designed and conducted, taking into account a background of well-known usability evaluation methods from HCI to help understanding why there are still open problems. A set of guidelines for a (more) user-centered usability evaluation of information visualization techniques is proposed and discussed. Our ultimate goal is to provide some insight regarding if and how sound ergonomic user-centered knowledge can be transferred to the information visualization context.},

abstract="Computer-based visualization environments enable their users to create, manipulate, and explore visual representations of data, information, processes and phenomena. They play a prominent role in the practices and education of many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) communities. There is a growing need to evaluate such environments empirically, in order not only to ensure that they are effective, but also to better understand how and why they are effective. How does one empirically evaluate the effectiveness of a visualization environment? I argue that choosing an approach is a matter of finding the right perspective for viewing human use of the visualization environment. This chapter presents three alternative perspectives---Cognitive, Social, and Cultural---each of which is distinguished by its own intellectual tradition and guiding theory. In so doing, the chapter has three broad goals: (a) to illustrate that different research traditions and perspectives lead to different definitions of effectiveness; (b) to show that, depending upon the research questions of interest and the situations in which a visualization environment is being used, each perspective can prove more or less useful in approaching the empirical evaluation of the environment; and (c) to provide visualization researchers with a repertoire of evaluation methods to draw from, and guidelines for matching research methods to research questions of interest.",
